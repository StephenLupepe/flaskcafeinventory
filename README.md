# flaskcafeinventory

This is an simple CRUD app built using Flask. Users can create, read, edit and delete objects from an SQL database.

I built this app to practice using Flask.

In the future, I would like to add additional features to this app, such as user authentication and the ability to interact
with the app through an API.
